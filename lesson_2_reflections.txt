What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you create your first repository it creates a .git file which is a hidden file and can be viewed b pressing CTRL + H, this then allows us to make commits 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area creates the basis on the first commit and we can decide which files we want to change for the commit
