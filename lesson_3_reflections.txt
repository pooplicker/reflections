When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if something happens to my computer containing my local commits i will lose all my progress, but if i upload it to the Git servers it can be accessed anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you are in control in what commits are relevant to your project and avoids cluttering of commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is when you clone a repository on GitHub onto your own GitHub account and the following changes you make go to your repository and not the original. Clones is when you clone a repository to your local repository on your computer. Branches is when a commit splits from the master branch
